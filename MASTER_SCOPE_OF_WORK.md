## 0) Ground Rules (L4 ‚Äî Autonomous, Closed‚ÄëLoop Evolution)
**Applies to every logic module (.py) and every integration.**
1. **Self‚ÄëLearning:** Each logic improves over time from new inputs, user corrections, and usage patterns. Include hooks/placeholders for GPT‚Äëbased evaluations, pattern extraction, confidence scoring, and retry logic.
2. **History‚ÄëAware:** Persist changelogs for invoices, bills, POs, salaries, items, taxes, etc. Track price changes, deltas by period, vendor and cross‚Äëorg deviation. Enable anomaly flags for manipulation and inconsistent trends.
3. **Reverse‚ÄëLearning from Custom Inputs:** On an unfamiliar report (e.g., new MIS PDF), auto‚Äëextract fields, map each figure to its Zoho origin, learn the format, and generate it next time without help. Log every new format learned.
4. **Expandable in the Same File:** Logic must grow inside its own .py (internal subtrees/strategies). Create new files only for base helpers/shared utilities.
5. **Smart Accounting Validation:** Autonomously check for accounting rule violations (unbalanced reversals, mismatched categories, missing journals, date anomalies) and suggest fixes.
6. **No Rewrites:** Everything is upgradable; no ‚Äústart from scratch.‚Äù Migrations and adapters preserve behavior while extending capability.
7. **Many‚Äëto‚ÄëOne Orchestration:** Reports (e.g., MIS) are composed by mediator/orchestrator modules that can call **2 ‚Üí ‚àû** logics. Configurable pipelines, partial retries, graceful degradation.
8. **Auto‚ÄëExpansion:** From repeated requests/patterns, auto‚Äëcreate/extend logic stubs (e.g., inferred `client_trend_analysis`) and register them safely with tests and guardrails.

## 1) Architecture & Folder Layout
```
repo/
  main.py                      # FastAPI app, MCP endpoints, tool router
  /logics/                     # 200+ operate files (one per logic, L4-compliant)
    logic_001_profit_loss.py
    ...
    logic_200_vendor_side_carbon_emissions_estimator.py
  /orchestrators/              # Mediators for multi-logic reports (e.g., MIS)
    mis_orchestrator.py
    generic_report_orchestrator.py
  /helpers/                    # Shared utilities (no business logic)
    zoho_client.py             # Auth, rate limiting, retries, caching
    pdf_extractor.py           # OCR/parse, table/field detection
    schema_registry.py         # JSONSchemas for inputs/outputs
    rules_engine.py            # Validations & guardrails

  /prompts/                    # Few-shot prompts & guidance (if/when LLM used)
  /tests/                      # Unit, integration, contract tests
  /docs/                       # ADRs, SOPs, how-tos
```

**Key tenets**
- **MCP‚Äëready**: `/mcp/manifest`, `/mcp/search`, `/mcp/fetch` with POST support; SSE where applicable.
- **Front‚Äëend agnostic**: No hard dependency on ChatGPT UI; callable from any client.
- **Observability**: Structured logs + metrics per logic and per orchestrated pipeline.
- **Security**: AuthN/Z for sensitive endpoints (`/generate_mis`, `/save_credentials`), rate limiting, input schemas.

---

## 2) Logic Module Contract (Template)
Each logic file **must implement**:
```python
# logic_xxx_example.py
\"\"\"
Title: <Human-friendly name>
ID: L-XXX
Tags: ["mis","pnl","compliance"]
Parent Logic: <optional>
Required Inputs: <typed schema or JSONSchema ref>
Outputs: <typed schema>
Assumptions: <explicit>
Evolution Notes: <how it self-learns; registries used>
\"\"\"

from typing import Any, Dict
from helpers.learning_hooks import record_feedback, score_confidence
from helpers.history_store import write_event
from helpers.rules_engine import validate_accounting

def handle(payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # 1) Validate & parse inputs (schema_registry)
    # 2) Fetch source data (zoho_client)
    # 3) Compute result (deterministic core)
    # 4) Run accounting validations
    # 5) Log history + deltas
    # 6) Self-learning hooks (update strategy weights, add patterns)
    # 7) Return outputs with confidence & provenance map
    return {
      "result": ...,
      "provenance": {...},  # zoho endpoints/ids that produced each figure
      "confidence": score_confidence(...),
      "alerts": [...],      # anomalies / rule violations
    }
```

**Self‚Äëlearning inside the file**
- Keep a small **strategy registry** (JSON or lightweight state) per logic to add variants/heuristics over time.
- Always record **provenance** (which Zoho entity/endpoint produced each figure).

---

## 3) Orchestration (2 ‚Üí ‚àû logics)
- **Graph‚Äëbased execution**: orchestrators define DAGs of logic calls with declared inputs/outputs.
- **Partial failure tolerance**: continue with available results; annotate missing pieces.
- **Auto‚Äëdiscovery**: orchestrator can discover and include new logics matching tags/rules.
- **Mediator examples**:
  - `mis_orchestrator.py` (configurable sections using 10‚Äì300+ logics)
  - `generic_report_orchestrator.py` (learned formats from PDFs/templates)

---

## 4) Reverse‚ÄëLearning Pipeline (New MIS PDFs ‚Üí Working Generators)
1. **Ingest** PDF ‚Üí `pdf_extractor.py` parses tables/labels/values.
2. **Field candidate mapping** to Zoho via heuristics + nomenclature maps.
3. **Provenance learning**: persist a mapping (field ‚Üí Zoho endpoint/filter/path).
4. **Schema capture**: register new report schema; version it.
5. **Verification pass**: reconcile against totals/subtotals; highlight mismatches.
6. **Auto‚Äëenable generation** next time; expose as an orchestrated report.

---

## 5) History, Deltas & Anomaly Detection
- **history_store**: append-only events: inputs, outputs, data snapshots, diffs.
- **delta_compare**: period‚Äëto‚Äëperiod (YoY, MoM), cross‚Äëorg, vendor‚Äëwise.
- **anomaly_engine**: rules + heuristics (e.g., backdated entry spikes, round‚Äëoff abuse, category drift).

---

## 6) Testing, Observability, and Upgrades
- **Tests**: unit per logic; integration for orchestrators; contract tests for Zoho APIs.
- **Telemetry**: per logic runtime, cache hit rate, error taxonomy, anomaly counts.
- **Upgrades**: adapters for signature changes; migration scripts for learned schemas; never rewrite from zero.

---

## 7) MCP Endpoints (Behavioral Spec)
- `/mcp/manifest`: declares tools/inputs/outputs; versioned.
- `/mcp/search` (POST): understands natural language to logic selection/plan.
- `/mcp/fetch` (POST): executes logic or orchestrated plans; streams progress if SSE enabled.
- **Security**: token‚Äëscoped per org; redaction for exports; rate limiters.

---

## 8) **Master Logic Index (200 modules, live)**
The following list is authoritative and will continue to grow.  
**Implementation rule:** one file per logic in `/logics/` named `logic_###_snake_case.py`.

‚úÖ Total Logics So Far: **200 and expanding**

This list is modular, meaning you can:
- Create `logics/logic_001_profit_loss.py` ‚Üí `logic_200_vendor_side_carbon_emissions_estimator.py`
- Each file contains 1 `handle(query)` or similar
- All are auto-registered via your loader in `main.py` for `/mcp/fetch` or API

### üìë Logic Category Annotations (Static vs Dynamic)

**Purpose:** This table classifies each logic in the Master Logic Index according to its nature and how it should evolve.

- **Static** = Core accounting/reporting functions. Logic rarely changes unless optimized or improved for performance/readability.
- **Dynamic (Regulation)** = Changes automatically when laws or compliance rules change (e.g., ITD/GST/TDS).
- **Dynamic (Patterns)** = Evolves based on anomaly detection, historical data drift, or detected irregularities.
- **Dynamic (Growth)** = Expands with business growth, new operational features, or SaaS-level enhancements.
- **Dynamic (Behavior)** = Learns from user requests, usage patterns, and reverse-learning of new formats.

| #   | Logic Name | Category | Rationale |
|-----|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1   | Profit and Loss Summary | Static | Canonical accounting statement |
| 2   | Balance Sheet | Static | Standard financial statement |
| 3   | Trial Balance | Static | Core ledger validation report |
| 4   | Capital Account Summary | Static | Standard capital tracking |
| 5   | Partner Withdrawals | Static | Deterministic calculation |
| 6   | Zone-wise Expenses | Static | Simple aggregation |
| 16  | GSTR Filing Status | Dynamic (Regulation) | Bound to GST compliance rules |
| 17  | TDS Filing Status | Dynamic (Regulation) | Bound to TDS law changes |
| 39  | Tax Summary Report | Dynamic (Regulation) | Updates when tax rates change |
| 40  | GST Reconciliation Status | Dynamic (Regulation) | Follows GSTN format changes |
| 41  | TDS Deducted vs Paid | Dynamic (Regulation) | Updates with TDS thresholds |
| 75  | Error Detection Engine | Dynamic (Patterns) | Evolves with anomaly heuristics |
| 76  | Anomaly Detection Report | Dynamic (Patterns) | Learns from history_store |
| 83  | Tax Liability Estimator | Dynamic (Regulation) | Adapts to ITD circulars |
| 85  | Late Filing Penalty Tracker | Dynamic (Regulation) | Follows compliance timelines |
| 88  | Profit Leakage Detector | Dynamic (Patterns) | Learns from repeated leaks |
| 92  | Suspense Account Monitor | Dynamic (Patterns) | Flags unusual journal entries |
| 93  | Accounting Hygiene Score | Dynamic (Patterns) | Scoring changes with usage |
| 95  | Scenario Simulation Engine | Dynamic (Growth) | Expands with new scenario types |
| 97  | Credit Rating Estimator | Dynamic (Growth) | Grows with more parameters |
| 151 | Audit Automation Wizard | Dynamic (Behavior) | Learns new audit steps |
| 161 | File Upload to Entry Mapper | Dynamic (Behavior) | Adapts to new file formats |
| 174 | Auto CA Remarks Based on Reports | Dynamic (Behavior) | Expands commentary with use |
| 178 | AI-Powered Explanation Tool | Dynamic (Behavior) | Learns to explain new terms |
| 179 | Journal Trace Visualizer | Dynamic (Behavior) | Expands with new trace types |
| 180 | Interlinked Report Mapper | Dynamic (Behavior) | Grows with linked report types |

_Note:_ All Dynamic logics follow L4 rules: they can self-learn, update rulesets, or spawn new stubs when triggered by relevant events.
