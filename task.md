## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Execution Strategy: Sequential & Independent
**✅ YES - You can execute tasks one by one within each phase!**

#### Phase 1: Independent Tasks (Can be done in any order)
- **1.1** → **1.2** → **1.3** → **1.4** (recommended order, but not required)
- Each task is self-contained and doesn't depend on others in Phase 1
- You can start with any task and complete them independently

#### Phase 2: Independent Tasks (Can be done in any order)
- **2.1** → **2.2** → **2.3** (recommended order, but not required)
- Each testing task is independent
- You can work on one logic's tests at a time

#### Phase 3: Some Dependencies
- **3.1** (Reverse-Learning) - Independent
- **3.2** (Orchestration) - Independent  
- **3.3** (Auto-Expansion) - Depends on 3.2 completion

#### Phase 4: Independent Tasks
- **4.1** → **4.2** → **4.3** (can be done in any order)

#### Phase 5: Independent Tasks
- **5.1** → **5.2** → **5.3** (can be done in any order)

### Cross-Phase Dependencies:
- **Phase 2** can start while Phase 1 is in progress
- **Phase 3** can start after Phase 1 is 50% complete
- **Phase 4** can start after Phase 2 is 50% complete
- **Phase 5** can be done anytime (future features)

### Recommended Execution Path:
1. **Start with 1.1** (L4 Contract Implementation) - Foundation for everything
2. **Then 1.2** (Self-Learning Hooks) - Builds on 1.1
3. **Then 1.3** (History-Aware) - Independent but uses 1.1 patterns
4. **Then 1.4** (Accounting Validation) - Independent
5. **Start 2.1** (Testing) in parallel with Phase 1 completion
6. **Continue with Phase 2** while Phase 1 finishes
7. **Begin Phase 3** when Phase 1 is complete

### Success Criteria:
- All 200 logics pass L4 compliance tests
- 80%+ test coverage achieved
- Reverse-learning pipeline functional
- MCP endpoints handle production loads
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Estimated Timeline:
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (can be done task by task)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks (can be done task by task)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (mostly independent)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks (independent tasks)
